# Experiment: Vowel MFCC & Speaker variability

- Vowels: /iy/ or /ae/
- MFCCs: 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 
- Speakers: 630

## Exp1) Within-speaker vowel variability

- Factor: Vowels, MFCCs
- Do /ae/ vectors cluster together? high-dim, low-dim
- Do /iy/ vectors cluster together? high-dim, low-dim
- [] Seperate within-speaker data
- [] Write a report

## Exp2) Between-speaker vowel variability

- Factor: Vowels, MFCCs
- [] Write a report

## Exp3) Change of features

- DV: FFT, LPC, LSF
- [] Write a report
