# Experiment: Vowel MFCC & Speaker variability

- Vowels: /iy/ or /ae/
- MFCCs: 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 
- Speakers: 630

## Exp1) Within-speaker vowel variability

- Factor: Vowels, MFCCs
- Do /ae/ vectors cluster together? high-dim, low-dim
- Do /iy/ vectors cluster together? high-dim, low-dim

## Exp2) Between-speaker vowel variability

- Factor: Vowels, MFCCs

## Exp3) Change of features

- DV: LPC, LSF
